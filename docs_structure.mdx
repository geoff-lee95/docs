Okay, let's map out a documentation site structure for "MESH AI," drawing inspiration from the Trunk.io documentation you linked and incorporating the PRD details we've developed.
Overall Goals for MESH AI Documentation
Clarity: Make complex concepts understandable to various audiences (agent developers, intent publishers, token holders).
Structure: Organize information logically for easy navigation and search.
Practicality: Provide code examples, tutorials, and how-to guides to enable quick adoption.
Completeness: Cover all aspects of the MESH AI platform, from core concepts to advanced features.
Maintainability: Design a structure that's easy to update as the platform evolves.
Proposed Documentation Site Structure for MESH AI
Here's a hierarchical structure with content suggestions based on our PRDs:
I. Introduction
1. Welcome to MESH AI

Key concepts: intents, agents, P2P network, Solana integration.
The agent economy vision.
2. Getting Started
Setting up a development environment.
Installing the MESH AI SDK.
Connecting to the MESH AI network (devnet/testnet/mainnet).
Creating a basic agent.
Publishing and fulfilling a simple intent.
II. Core Concepts
1. Intents
Intent definition and lifecycle.

Verifiable Credentials (VCs).
Agent registration and management.
3. P2P Network
Network architecture and protocols.
Agent communication.
Agent discovery.
Network topology and scalability.
4. Solana Integration
On-chain vs. off-chain responsibilities.
Solana's role as a trust and settlement layer.
Solana's resource limitations and how to address them.

Smart contract security.
Agent security best practices.
Risk mitigation and opt-in safeguards.
5. Dispute Resolution
Dispute resolution process.
Juror selection and responsibilities.
Evidence submission and adjudication.
Appeal mechanisms.
On-chain enforcement.
V. Reference

Intent Description Language (IDL) Specification
Glossary of Terms
Key Considerations
Trunk.io Inspiration:
Clear Navigation: Like Trunk.io, use a prominent sidebar for easy access to sections.
Search Functionality: Implement a robust search to help users quickly find specific information.
Code Examples: Provide plenty of code snippets and examples in relevant languages (Rust, Python, etc.).
Version Control: If the platform has versioning, document changes and updates clearly.
Community Resources: Link to forums, chat channels, or other community platforms.
Audience-Specific Content:
Agent Developers: Focus on the SDK, agent lifecycle, and verifiable computation.
Intent Publishers: Emphasize intent creation, negotiation, and dispute resolution.
Token Holders: Highlight governance, tokenomics, and security.
Visuals and Diagrams:
Use diagrams to illustrate complex concepts (e.g., network topology, intent lifecycle).
Incorporate visuals to enhance understanding and engagement.
Interactive Elements:
Consider interactive elements like code editors or playgrounds to allow users to experiment.
This structure provides a solid foundation for documenting the MESH AI platform. Remember to prioritize clarity, practicality, and maintainability to create a valuable resource for the community.
